# Summary
MLB product has tasked you with writing a weather app using the latest Android technologies and architecture. This application should provide the forecast for the next 5 days. 

## Logistics
Publish your work to your own personal repository (Github, Gitlab, etc)
  * Provide a link via email to the completed project.
  * Reach out via email if you have any questions. 

### Show your work
  * Showing commit history is encouraged.

### Timing
* We suggest spending 3-5 hours on the exercise. 
* Please submit your solution no later than 2 weeks after it has been received.
  * If an extension is needed, please let me know via email. 

## Tasks
* Write the weather application leveraging Jetpack components where possible.
  * We recommend using the [openWeather](https://openweathermap.org) API. If you have another preference, feel free to use a different service. 
* The app should prompt the user to enter a Zip code and show the weather forecast for that location for the next 5 days.
* The user should be able to click on each line item and transition to a new view to get the weather description for that day. Feel free to add additional information to this view if you think it might help the user plan their day.
* The application should include caching. Weather information should still be accessible even when the user is offline.

## Guidelines
* Pull in any external library if necessary.
* We strongly recommend that you use Kotlin.
* You have full creative control over the code, views, and structure. Do what makes sense for long
term maintainability and testability. 

## Expectations
* The UI should look the same OR better.
* The app should be extensible. Product will be adding additional features overtime and the architecture should accommodate this.


## Bonus Round
* Add unit tests
